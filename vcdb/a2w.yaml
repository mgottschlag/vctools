  The A2W register region seems to contain at least the settings of the various
  PLLs used for clock generation. The peripheral document lists a number of
  clock sources in the section about GPIO clock generation.

  Per default, the videocore processor uses the PLLC while the ARM core uses
  the PLLA and other components use the PLLD.

  Some information is available at http://elinux.org/RPi_Overclocking.

            Fractional part of the PLL multiplier - the resulting multiplier is
